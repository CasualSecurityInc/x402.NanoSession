- Created root package.json for x402 monorepo.
- Defined workspaces: ["packages/*", "examples/*"].
- Added npm scripts: test, test:run, test:integration, build, clean.
- Declared devDependencies: vitest, typescript, tsx, @types/node with versions.
- Enforced engines: node >=18.0.0.
- Plan to extend with more monorepo tooling (lint, prettier) later.
