Final blurb wording decision (append-only):
- Intro blurb text for x402.NanoSession Rev3 intro was set to:
  "x402.NanoSession defines a straightforward per-request HTTP 402 scheme for access to web resources and APIs. Payments are settled instantly and feelessly via Nano (XNO), avoiding smart‑contract overhead."
- Rationale: Keeps language concise, accessible to both M2M operators and human users, and removes references to previous raw tagging emphasis.
