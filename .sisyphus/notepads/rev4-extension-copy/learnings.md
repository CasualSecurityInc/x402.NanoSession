- Task: Create 3 rev4 Extension docs by copying rev3 and updating headers to rev4.
- Actions:
  1) Read rev3 files for A Pools, B Stochastic, and x402 Compat.
  2) Create 3 new rev4 files with updated headers (Date, Extension For).
  3) Verify headers contain rev4 references via grep.
- Rationale: Keeps a canonical rev4 extension set in docs/ while preserving rev3 content for history.
- Results: All 3 rev4 files created and grep confirms rev4 references.
- Next steps: If needed, update site build references and ensure no broken links.
