- Created exercise: added /examples/client/package.json for nanosession example client.
- File path: /Users/conny/Developer/CasualSecurityInc/x402.NanoSession/examples/client/package.json
- Content summary:
- {
-   "name": "@nanosession/examples-client",
-   "version": "0.1.0",
-   "description": "Example NanoSession x402 payment client",
-   "type": "module",
-   "scripts": {"start": "tsx src/index.ts"},
-   "dependencies": {
-     "@nanosession/core": "workspace:*",
-     "@nanosession/client": "workspace:*"
-   },
-   "devDependencies": {}
- }
- This aligns with the minimal viable example client approach and avoids heavy frameworks.

- Added core address pool abstraction (AddressPool, StandardAccountPool) using nanocurrency derivation via dynamic require to avoid new core dependency.
- Integration test now derives account #0/#1 addresses from seed and performs real mainnet send/receive/sweep flows using RPC block_create/process with confirmation polling.
