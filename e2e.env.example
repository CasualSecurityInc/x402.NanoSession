# NanoSession x402 Integration Test Environment
# Copy this file to e2e.env and fill in your values
# DO NOT commit e2e.env to git (it's gitignored)

# Test wallet seed (64 character hex string)
# This wallet must have a small amount of XNO for testing
# The test will use HD derivation to create accounts from this seed:
#   - Account #0: Client account (source of payments)
#   - Account #1: Server account (receives payments)
NANO_TEST_SEED=your_64_char_hex_seed_here

# Nano RPC endpoint URL
# Default: https://rpc.nano.to (community node)
NANO_RPC_URL=https://rpc.nano.to

# Maximum spend per test run (in raw)
# 0.001 XNO = 1000000000000000000000000000 raw
# Keep this small to avoid accidental large spends
NANO_MAX_SPEND=1000000000000000000000000000

# HD Account Derivation Info:
# The integration test uses Nano's seed+index model:
#   Account 0 (Client): deriveAddress(seed, 0)
#   Account 1 (Server): deriveAddress(seed, 1)
# 
# Test flow:
#   1. Sweep any funds from Account 1 → Account 0 (setup)
#   2. Create payment from Account 0 → Account 1
#   3. Broadcast and verify on mainnet
#   4. Sweep remaining funds from Account 1 → Account 0 (cleanup)
# 
# Requirements:
#   - Account 0 must have balance for test payments + minimum account balance
#   - Minimum account balance on Nano is currently 0.0001 XNO
#   - Each test run spends real XNO (very small amounts)
